**Aim:** to rank sentences in a research paper based on its importance.

**Tasks:**

1. research current approaches for extractive document summarization;
2. collect and analise the data;
3. develop API for pdf files changes (including telegram bot);
4. develop preprocessing pipeline for the text that is extracted from pdf;
5. segment the text on small parts (i.e. sentences or topics);
6. rank these small parts using a developed algorithm;
7. select top n the most important parts of the pdf text;
8. get the pdf coordinates of selected parts of the text and highlight it;
9. evaluate metrics on the dataset;
10. deploy the service on a server;
11. write a report about the developed system.
